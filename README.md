# neuron
neural networks for brain image analysis

In development, right now testing large architecture for neuroanatomy segmentation.  
Strategy for now:

- U-net style architecture modelled as likelihood probability
- Model spatial prior information as an added input combined with the likelihood 
 

### Requirements:
numpy, MedPy (soon)
